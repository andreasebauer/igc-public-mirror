OE public surface (signatures only; no implementation).

Staging rule:
- Metrics are grouped by ppN stage labels (integers). Execution order is strictly ascending:
  [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, ...] â€” i.e., pp2 is simply skipped unless present in the selected set.

All path construction uses DB PathRegistry (no string templates in code).
